# Magnetic tiles blow hole defects segmentation using Unet

In this example, segmentation was done on identifying the area of blow hole in the magnetic tiles using deep learning approach.

The dataset is available from:

https://github.com/abin24/Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets

And the deep learning model UNet is adapted from:
